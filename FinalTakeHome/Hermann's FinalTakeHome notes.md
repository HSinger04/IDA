* 68 participants in Experiment I (uni students: See Methods -> Participants), 70 ooriginally, but two excluded
  * randomly assigned to one of the two stimulus sets: easily-verbalizable and not-easily verbalizable. This affected only the visual
appearance of the stimuli used and the experiment proceeded
identically regardless of condition. Participants in both
conditions were introduced to the game “Monster Farm”
where they would play as a farmer and their job was to figure
out which group each of the “monsters” living on a farm
belonged to. They were also told that some features or aspects
of the monsters might help them determine the correct group,
either group A or group B. On each trial, they would need to
select a collar for the monster with the group letter using
either the A or B key. If the classification was correct, they
were shown a check mark; if the classification was incorrect,
they were shown an X. This feedback was displayed with the
stimulus still visible until the next trial began automatically
after a few seconds. The training phase would continue until a subject had
completed at least four blocks (60 trials) and completed at
least twelve trials in a row correctly. If a subject did not
complete this criterion within 400 trials or one hour, the game
would end without the testing phase and the participant’s data
would not be further analyzed. After reaching the criterion,
both groups entered the testing phase. In this phase, subjects
were shown each of the test stimuli in Table 2 and sorted the
monster, as in the training phase, into the group they thought
it belonged to. In this phase, there was no feedback on their
decisions and each stimulus was shown once in a randomized
order.
* Data:
  * Stimuli:
    * easily-verbalizable (Materials > Stimuli):
      * spots (two vs. four)
      * eyes (two vs. three)
      * ear colour (teal vs. orange)
      * tail shape (square vs. triangle)
      * back colour (red vs. green)
    * not-easily verbalizable (Materials > Stimuli):
      * spots (uneven stripes vs. uniform polka)
      * eyes (narrow and vertical vs. wide and horizontal)
      * ear shape (short and pointed vs. long and floppy)
      * nose shape (long and pointed vs. short and blunt)
      * back shape (short bumpy "spines" vs. tall "sail")
* Norming study: "The
norming study was designed to collect descriptions of the
features from one group of individuals and determine if
another group of individuals could then identify the same
feature based on those descriptions." - The one with two phases and amazon turk
  *  Phase I
    * 63 participants 
    * Shown one of the four stimulus prototypes (table 1), followed by one of the features in isolation. They were then asked to describe the individual
features in the provided text box. Then, for each feature, the
two most common descriptors from the 63 responses were
selected to be used in Phase Two.
  * Phase II
    * 30 individuals
    * Shown top two descriptors from phase I. Then, askek, out of the two paired features, which was best fit by descriptors. (unclear)
* Training categories
  * Each category contained 
    * 15 stimuli with five exemplars presented in three pixel sizes (small, medium, large)
    * included prototype and four stimuli that varied by a single feature. One random feature would always be present on all stimuli in the category.
* Testing categories (todo / unclear)    
* Categories
  * easily-verbalizable
  * not-easily verbalizable
* Strategies
  * Family resemble (FR)
  * critical attribute (CA)
